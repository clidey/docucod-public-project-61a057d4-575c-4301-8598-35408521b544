# Installation Instructions

Get step-by-step instructions to install the **BSP.Dependency.Injection** framework on your development machine or in your .NET projects. This guide covers package referencing methods for all supported environments and the minimal integration steps required to start using the framework immediately.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing BSP.Dependency.Injection, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Any OS supporting .NET Core 3.1 or later (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **.NET SDK:** .NET Core SDK version 3.1 or higher installed
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio 2019+, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains Rider, or any compatible IDE

You can verify your .NET SDK installation by running:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

It should output version 3.1.x or higher.

<Tip>
If you do not have the .NET Core SDK installed, download it from the official Microsoft website: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installation Methods

The BSP.Dependency.Injection framework is distributed as a .NET class library. You can add it to your project using one of these methods:

### 2.1. Via NuGet Package Manager (if available)

> _Note: If the package is available on NuGet.org, you may install with this command:_

```bash
dotnet add package BSP.Dependency.Injection
```

### 2.2. Adding the Project Reference Locally

If you cloned the BSP.Dependency.Injection repository manually, add the project directly to your solution.

**Steps:**

1. Clone or download the [BSP.Dependency.Injection repository](https://github.com/bspjojo/DependencyInjection).
2. Open your solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Add a reference to the `BSP.Dependency.Injection.csproj` located in the `BSP.Dependency.Injection` folder.

Example command line to add project reference:

```bash
dotnet add reference ../BSP.Dependency.Injection/BSP.Dependency.Injection.csproj
```

---

## 3. Initial Integration

After installation, integrate the framework by adding service registrations to your code. This includes defining your service mappings with desired lifetimes: Singleton, Scoped, or Transient.

### 3.1. Add `using` Directive

Include the namespace where the dependency injection classes reside:

```csharp
using BSP.Dependency.Injection.DependencyInjection;
```

### 3.2. Create and Configure a `ServiceMappingStore`

This store manages all your service mappings.

```csharp
var serviceMappingStore = new ServiceMappingStore();

// Register services with lifetimes
serviceMappingStore.AddSingleton<IYourService, YourServiceImplementation>();
serviceMappingStore.AddScoped<IOtherService, OtherServiceImplementation>();
serviceMappingStore.AddTransient<IAnotherService, AnotherServiceImplementation>();

// Perform integrity check to catch circular dependencies
serviceMappingStore.IntegrityCheck();
```

### 3.3. Create a `Scope` to Resolve Services

Instantiate the `Scope` class by passing in your configured `ServiceMappingStore`. Use it to get service instances.

```csharp
var scope = new Scope(serviceMappingStore);

var myServiceInstance = scope.GetInstance<IYourService>();
myServiceInstance.DoSomething();
```

<Tip>
Calling `IntegrityCheck()` early during startup is essential. This prevents runtime exceptions from circular dependencies or missing service mappings.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Verification Steps

### 4.1. Build Your Solution

Make sure your project compiles successfully after adding the package and references.

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 4.2. Run the Example Application

If you are using the `BSP.Example` project included in the repository, build and run it to see the framework in action.

```bash
dotnet run --project BSP.Example/BSP.Example.csproj
```

You should see console output reflecting service instantiation logs and method calls, demonstrating Singleton, Scoped, and Transient lifetimes.

### 4.3. Expected Output Snippet

```
BSP.Example.Cases.Classes.DepClass5 to BSP.Example.Cases.Classes.DepClass5 in scope Transient
BSP.Example.Cases.Classes.DepClass4 to BSP.Example.Cases.Classes.DepClass4 in scope Scoped
... (other logging lines) ...
DepClass5.DoThing - <GUID>
DepClass4.DoThing - <GUID>
...
```

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation and Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Missing .NET SDK or Incorrect Version">
Ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.1 or higher installed. Running `dotnet --version` should return 3.1.x or higher.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Project Reference Errors">
Verify the `BSP.Dependency.Injection.csproj` path is correct and the reference is added to your consuming project.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Circular Dependency Exceptions on Integrity Check">
Review your service mappings. The framework's `IntegrityCheck()` method will throw an exception if circular dependencies exist. Remove or refactor these dependencies before continuing.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Service Not Registered Exception When Resolving">
Add explicit service mappings for all interfaces before calling `GetInstance<T>()`. Missing bindings will cause exceptions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Start with minimal service registrations and incrementally add more to isolate errors quickly.
</Tip>
